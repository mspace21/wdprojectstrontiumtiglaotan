## Website Details
  1. **Title:** **Merge** <br>
    *Where work meets your fitness*
  2. **Brief Description:** <br>
    Merge, where your work meets your fitness, is a workspace for students who prioritize their academics and fitness. This workspace encourages students to keep a well-balanced life, through having a day-by-day goal-oriented approach to their priorities and tasks.
  3. **Outline:** The website will have one main webpage. This page will contain different sections each with their respective purposes. The sections will expand to full-size when prompted, allowing the user to focus on the contents of said section.<br>
  4. **JavaScript Integration:** Javascript can be integrated into many parts of the website, notably, it can be used to create new HTML elements (such as in the journal section and exercise plan explained above). It can also be used for design aspects such as animation between/throughout panels and for various visual effects in the website.<br>
  5. **Wireframe:** [Canva Link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGVnRy9Nv4/ClX_k2_jI99MWqn3G5-Fng/edit?utm_content=DAGVnRy9Nv4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) <br>
